# library-project

**General Info**

Promted by the Odin Project self-directed/self-guided course, I was tasked with creating a library using class functions and the DOM.
This project took a lot longer than anticipated but I learned quite a bit about manipulating the DOM, positioning elements with CSS Grid, and transitions in CSS. 

The most challenging part of the project for me was getting the book cards to show up on the webpage in a manner that was intuitive and seamless. After days of trial an error, I was finally able to achieve the desired result. 

**Concepts Covered**

Functional programming | Classes | Arrays | DOM Manipulation | Advanced CSS (CSS Grid, CSS variables) 

**Technologies**

HTML | CSS | Javascript
